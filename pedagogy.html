					Create opportunities for young people to be involved in the planning of CS curriculum.
				</li>
				<li>
					Allow students to explore multiple facets of CS - game design, writing, mobile app games, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create guidelines for students and have them consider what it means to create a space where all identities are welcome.
				</li>
				<li>
					Computer science doesn't need to be taught just through computers; that creates barriers for students.
					Using resources like books or giving examples for CS language and code can impact students as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					Encouraging students to understand why they are in CS class, and why these concepts are important to them or relevant to their lives and learning.

				Unplugged Pedagogy
			</header>

			<p class="font">
				According to “A critical review of literature on "unplugged" pedagogies in K-12 computer science
				and computational thinking education,”
				this guide cites Bell et. all 1998 for coining “unplugged” computer science (CS) and computational
				thinking (CT) education. This review of the pedagogy is a way for educators to understand the efficacy of
				using this pedagogy, and adopting it in their classrooms as a means to expose more students to STEM.
				<br>
				<br>
				Computer Science Unplugged (CSU) is the idea of teaching computer science without computers.
				This removes barriers of technological access for young people to learn computer science,
				and creates a more welcoming environment for students from all backgrounds, but particularly
				marginalized students who have traditionally been barred entry from STEM and CS-related courses.
				Using this pedagogy means creating content that embraces student learning, having inquiry-based pedagogy,
				and increasing purpose for young learners.

				<li>While this pedagogy is rooted in teaching CS without computers, other options for activities
				would include creating mobile phone apps or doing game design as a way to create interest.
				</li>
				<li>CSU is not a perfect pedagogy. While it is an option to increase learning in (and outside of) the classroom,
				it can be difficult to sustain interest. (Huang, W., & Looi, C.-K. 2021, p. 99)

				K-12 CS education - why do we do it?
			</header>
			<p class="font">
				In “Computer science in K-12 school curricula of the 2lst century: Why, what and when?”,
				this study focused on the role of how computer science curriculum design can affect students.
				This paper was written by the Task Force of the Education Committee (TC3) of the International
				Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) to examine how computer science education and educators
				evaluate and consider how their curriculum is designed.
			<br>
			<br>
				With the framework of computer science as “powerful knowledge,” as coined by Young (2013) as cited within this study,
				this framework cements that knowledge of computer science is deemed an important part of learning and
				as a means of keeping up with technological advances in the world. What does that mean for us to take
				CS education and transform it in our classrooms? With studies conducted in the UK, Israel, Poland, and
				Australia on their CS education, we can see that CS education around the world have adapted their curriculum in various ways,
				including: pairing other classes with CS education, addressing curriculum by allowing teachers to utilize old and
				new curriculum to create “appropriate learning contexts” (Multiple authors 2017, p. 8), and allowing
				teachers to develop pedagogically.
			<br>
			<br>
			This study recommends that we ask the following questions when we plan our curriculum and in our pedagogical practices:

			<ol class="font">
				<li>What is the range of skills and understanding that should be developed?
				</li>
				<li>Are such skills and understanding necessary for everyone?
				</li>
				<li>At what age should such education commence? If so, to what extent should it be
				and possibly remain compulsory?
				</li>
				<li>What pedagogical approaches are likely to be appropriate, and how do they vary
				with age and other factors? (p. 448)
				</li>
			</ol>
