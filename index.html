				Why should we queer computer science education?
			</header>

			<p class="font">
				According to "Successful K-12 STEM Education : Identifying Effective Approaches in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics," created by the National
				Research Council, about "75% of eighth graders are not proficient in mathematics" (Multiple authors, 2011, p. 4). Given this statistic, this guide for successful STEM
				education cites STEM-focused schools and STEM outcomes for student success as two initiatives that can increase student participation and enjoyment of STEM.
				<br>
				<br>
				Given this statistic, it is imperative to think of how and why students are uninterested or "not proficient" in STEM fields. By queering the way that we view computer science education
				as a shoot-off entry point into STEM education as a whole, we can think of creating spaces in K-12 schools that promote STEM with equality for all students of all backgrounds.

			<header class="headers">
				How do I use this tool?
			</header>
			<p class="font">
				This tool is intended for educators in the K-12 space, but there will also be references to STEM and Computer Science education at the undergraduate and graduate level as a way to
				think of how we can approach learning for K-12 students to mitigate adverse effects for them in the future. To use this tool, you can check out the "theory" page which will cover what
				"queering" means, and will have pedagogy that can be used in the Computer Science classroom.
			</p>

			<header class="headers">
			Why is this important to me? Why should I care?
			</header>
			<p class="font">
				Depending on where you are, Computer Science education in K-12 spaces is relatively new. Given the pervasiveness of technology and computer science, it is
				imperative to consider how we can change the education of computer science to be more inclusive - both in the classroom and in the curriculum.
				Pedagogically, offering opportunities for teachers and students to queer the classroom by upending restrictive and punitive teaching models for a field
				that is traditionally meant for cishet white men allows for greater change.
				<br>
				<br>

				By queering these educational spaces for young people, we can see increases in diversity and belonging for QTBIPOC in the landscape of CS.
				Young people can see themselves in CS and by slowly dismantling the oppressive systems in the classroom through pedagogical practice,
				we can hopefully see that change as young people are encouraged to join the field of CS as they grow and learn.
