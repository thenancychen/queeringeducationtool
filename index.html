				This is a tool about queering how we teach computer science in K-12 spaces. Some questions that arose from this project were: how come STEM is predominantly geared towards and privileges cis men? How do we ensure that voices of queer and trans youth of color enter these spaces, especially at a young age? What does it look like to create a space for marginalized folks, and evoke belonging from the very beginning?

			<h1>Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>

			<p>Hello! I'm Nancy and this website is a compilation of all the projects that I completed for Visual Media Design 105. It was my first time taking any type of visual design class and I really enjoyed it! I learned a lot from this course and this website showcases every final project I completed throughout the semester. </p>
