					<li>Some questions that arose from this project were: how come STEM is predominantly geared towards and privileges cis men? </li>
					<li>How do we ensure that voices of queer and trans youth of color enter these spaces, especially at a young age?</li> 
					<li>What does it look like to create a space for marginalized folks, and evoke belonging in spaces for young people who may not have the privilege or resource to be introduced and engaged in STEM? </li>

				Why should we queer computer science education?
			</header>

			<p class="font">
				According to "Successful K-12 STEM Education : Identifying Effective Approaches in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics," created by the National
				Research Council, about "75% of eighth graders are not proficient in mathematics" (Multiple authors, 2011, p. 4). Given this statistic, this guide for successful STEM
				education cites STEM-focused schools and STEM outcomes for student success as two initiatives that can increase student participation and enjoyment of STEM.
				<br>
				<br>
				Given this statistic, it is imperative to think of how and why students are uninterested or "not proficient" in STEM fields. By queering the way that we view computer science education
				as a shoot-off entry point into STEM education as a whole, we can think of creating spaces in K-12 schools that promote STEM with equality for all students of all backgrounds.

				How do I use this tool? 
			</header>
			<p class="font">
				This tool is intended for educators in the K-12 space, but there will also be references to STEM and Computer Science education at the undergraduate level. 
				To use this tool, you can check out the "theory" page which will cover what "queering" means, and will have pedagogy that can be used in the Computer Science classroom.
