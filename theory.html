				CS Education for LGBTQ undergrads and graduate students
			</header>

			<p class="font">
				Research from “Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Students' Sense of Belonging in Computing: An Intersectional Approach” cites
				that undergraduate and graduate student experiences in computer science and computing departments were generally negative for LGBTQ and
				female-identified students. While this study is focused on the landscape of computer science, it is helpful to gather context from this research
				as a way to understand how the current landscape of CS is, and what we are trying to do in K-12 CS classrooms to mitigate this for future generations.
				<br>
				<br>
				At the higher education level, more women at the graduate level tend to want to leave computer science compared to the undergraduate level.
				There is a low sense of belonging for both LGBTQ students and female-identified students.
				In order to mitigate this, this research study says that increasing diversity and perspectives in the field is the answer to having longevity.

				By having this piece center on what CS education is like in the higher education space, we can think about what this means for our K-12 learners.
				How do we create spaces that are diverse and equitable, and will keep our young people in the field if that is what they want to pursue? How do we stop them from getting pushed out?

				K-12 Education
			</header>
			<p class="font">
				Thinking about the “Successful K-12 STEM Education : Identifying Effective Approaches in Science, Technology,
				Engineering, and Mathematics” reading, we can think about these three ways to frame queering Computer Science education,
				and crafting a more inclusive space for young people:
			<br>
			<ul class="font">
				<li>Coherent curriculum and instruction that is rigorous and covers a multitude of topics
				</li>
				<li>Beginning with STEM classes starting in K-5 spaces will enhance student experiences and encourage them to be involved in STEM as they reach adolescence
				</li>
				<li>Teachers with large capacity for instruction by focusing on STEM
				</li>
				<li>Professional development for teachers to craft curriculum and understand what student success can look like in CS education
				</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="font">
				By employing these methods in schools and in the classroom,
				there is a greater opportunity for young people to feel included and gain success in the field of STEM. On a wider level, these are
				ways to queer Computer Science education in a K-12 space. By having broader opportunities for curriculum and teachers who have
				larger capacities for instruction, this means that students will have more support. The hope in crafting STEM spaces for students in a K-5 space will nurture
				and hopefully increase the diversity of students in the field.
